# 🎵 AI-Powered Music Generation 🎹

This project demonstrates how to build a simple AI-powered music generator using deep learning techniques (LSTM networks) in Python. Unlike traditional models that require massive MIDI datasets (e.g., MAESTRO, 101GB), this version generates and learns from a **synthetic dataset** of musical notes. Perfect for learning and demonstrating music generation with AI in a lightweight environment.

## 🚀 Features

- Generates original music using **LSTM-based neural networks**
- No external dataset required (uses synthetic notes)
- Outputs playable **MIDI files**
- Runs easily in **Jupyter Lab** with minimal dependencies
